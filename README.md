# weatherapp
This is a weather app that I made by watching a youtube tutorial. This weather app uses an HTML file and a CSS file to make the UI and everything else about the app. 

The tutorial link is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIYQR-Ybrn4

I added a couple of tweaks that I thought would be interesting to see like the real-feel and the high and lows.

This works by entering a city name or a city, state, and country name.
